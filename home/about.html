                         Dibrugarh A fructiferous tree from the tiny sapling Sri Sathya Sai Education is an integral part of Sai Mission through which the legacy of Sathya Sai will be carried forward by the coming generation of centuries. 
                         Swami emphasized this time and again in many of his divine discourses and through establishment of many education institutions of excellence well known world over. 
                         Following the divine directive, many devotees, group of devotees, trust and societies started Sai School in different parts of our country and abroad to impart value-based education to create a new generation of young people who can be a noble and responsible citizen and work as worthy instruments for His divine mission.
                          Later 99 Sri Sathya Sai schools were standardized and monitored by the Institute of Sathya Sai Education, Mumbai (Est. 09/01/2000) through accreditation process and involving the students, teachers, parents and management. Devotees of Sri Sathya Sai Seva Samithi, Dibrugarh could not keep themselves aloof from this fragrant breeze - blowing with the Divine Sankalpa.
                           It was the late nineties when Assam was in the grip of horrible disturbance and young generation was swept under the current of violence, aggressiveness and social unrest, under such an unfavourable atmosphere some devoted souls of Dibrugarh Samithi felt the honest need to follow the path shown by Swami to foster Human Values in the upcoming generation through establishment ofa school. 
                           A project report prepared by education sub-committee of this Samithi received the blessing of Swami at Brindavan and the Prospectus of the school was also later accepted by Swami at Prasanthi Nilayam. Established on 8h June 1997 in a rented house as a sapling with the wholehearted support by the Devotees under the auspices of Sri Sathya Sai Seva Samithi, Dibrugarh the school has now grown into a big fruit laden tree with all its fragrances.
                            Registered as Prasanthi Divine Valley School under Board of Secondary Education Assam (SEBA), today the school is named as Sri Sathya Sai Prasanthi Divine Valley School running in four storied buikding of its own ina serene atmosphere and well secured boundary wall. The school was accredited grade "A" by the Institute of Sri Sathya Sai Education, Mumbai in the year 2010 after a team of experts evaluated the school on the specified parameters. 
                            The school added another feather in its cap in 2014 when it came under the supportive umbrella of Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Vahini (SSSVV) project of Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust. Under this project the school was provided fellowship teachers at diferent intervals for a specific period oftime and also visiting facuty who conducted training, orientation and huddle programme for teachers. The dedicated service provided by 3 resident fellowship teachers and 4 visiting faculty at different occasions resulted in visible and appreciable change in all the four domains - Classroom, Corridor, Campus & Community. 
                            The learning process in the school has become more Insightful, Inspiring, Enjoyable & Participative. Eventually in 2017, the school [7] got the coveted distinction of being declared by SSSVV as one of the "LIGHT HOUSE SCHOOL" among the Sri Sathya Sai schools in India. Regular Vedam recitation is another unique feature of learning programme in the school. An alumnus of Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning (SSSIHL), Sri C. B. S. Mani has been conducting Vedam training every year and his 9 consecutive visits till now has been a selfless service at the lotus feet. 
                            The school is looking for many more achievements before it celebrates its Silver Jubilee in 2022. It needs to be understood that Sri Sathya Sai Prasanthi Divine Valley School is a full time, independent, private school with some characteristic features which distinguishes it from other private schools. The most distinguishing feature being the integration of pedagogy of integral education with the philosophy ofSri Sathya Sai Educare in the school curriculum. The school has achieved a constant record of 100% success in Board result mostly with the first division for consecutive Nine years since the first batch came out.
